== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, two more patches were merged:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=e3a5c77388ae3791afed4f4286ec7e41e5b9f7c3[libgccjit: Fix bug where unary_op will return an integer type instead of the correct type]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git;h=e484755aecd543b4c9e2adb4f348118c1e43cfd0[target: Fix asm generation for AVX builtins when using -masm=intel [PR106095\]]

I still have a few that I need to prepare and send for review and I'll send them on the GCC mailing list this month.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/181[Support more target-specific intrinsics] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/182[Remove duplicated intrinsics and add check]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/185[Add dummy fast math implementation]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/186[Update intrinsics tool] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/187[Prevent invalid intrinsics conversion generation] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/188[Simplify CI] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/189[Disable UI tests that fail on the rustc side]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/190[Support more SIMD]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/193[Parallelize CI] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/195[Split rustc tests in two] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/196[Split tests to have faster CI] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

Thanks to GuillaumeGomez, the CI now runs a whole lot faster!

This month, I've made enough progress on SIMD to be able to compile the stdarch tests.
Here are the results of running those tests:

[script,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 4548 passed; 28 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 1.06s
----

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
