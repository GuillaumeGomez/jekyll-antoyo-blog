== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, some progress was made:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/17[Fix compilation error when bfloat is unsupported] (thanks to Heath123!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/18[Add support for the `cold` function attribute] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/19[Add ability to get CPU features]

None of these were sent as patches to GCC yet.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/279[Regen intrinsics with latest LLVM version] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/282[Sync from rust 2023/06/11]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/286[Add support for cold attribute] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/299[Add support for detecting CPU features]

Apart for that, I continued working on https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/278[Link-Time Optimization (LTO)] support: I managed to fix the GCC's garbage collector issue and tried LTO on a personal project of mine.
Without LTO, the program compiled with GCC is around 5% slower than the one compiled with LLVM.
With LTO, both GCC and LLVM brings a performance benefit of around 40%.
It's interesting to see that LTO give around the same performance improvement for both GCC and LLVM.

Finally, since one of the goals of this project is to be able to run Rust code on new platforms, I created a https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/wiki[wiki page] that shows on which new platforms some people succeeded in compiling Rust code on.
There isn't much there yet, but the idea is to complete it when people try to compile Rust on new platforms.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: add progress of compiling some projects.

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/5469252330/jobs/9957949859#step:19:1571
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/5469252330/jobs/9957949982#step:19:1565
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/5469252330/jobs/9957950108#step:19:4032 (failures)

|===
| Category | Last Month | This Month | Delta

For the next month, I'll continue working on link-time optimization.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
