== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

No progress on this front for this month, but I worked on the following that I'll need to clean up later and send as patches:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/fd603a3c715d3708f831cb637fbcc48bf4641859[Add support for try/catch]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/88a4ad491216455c96ca2a797b2d9fb1f3d81881[Add support for the type bfloat16]

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/244[Implement unwinding]

That was one big feature that was remaining to be implemented and I finally got it to work.
I'll need to clean up that stuff and fix the issues that make some tests fail, but that's a big achievement.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: add progress of compiling some projects.

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3889961276/jobs/6638658577#step:20:12025
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3889961276/jobs/6638658509#step:20:12025
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3889961276/jobs/6638658635#step:20:15232 (failures)

|===
| Category | Last Month | This Month | Delta

| Passed | 4796 | 4821 | +25
| Failed | 43 | 65 | +22
|===

There are more failures since I re-enabled the tests for panics and unwinding.

For the next month, I'll fix the undefined behavior issues that we have and that cause some tests to fail when compiled in release mode.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
