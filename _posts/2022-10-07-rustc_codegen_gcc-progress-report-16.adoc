== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, I did the following:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/b12ad58f4e4076bd72bb62c4edb4f348d47e0cda[Support signed char flag]

While debugging the stdarch tests, I found out some of them were failing because libgccjit would assume `char` is unsigned by default while it needed to be signed for the builtins to work properly.
This commit is not yet posted as a patch for review.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/215[simd: impl extract_element for vector types] (thanks to sadlerap!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/218[Fix build of release sysroot in test.sh]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/219[simd: implement float math intrinsics] (thanks to sadlerap!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/224[Fix a few bugs that happen only in release mode]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/226[Implement llvm.prefetch]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/227[Fix warnings in some examples]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/228[simd: enable simd_as intrinsic] (thanks to sadlerap!)

If you attended my https://youtu.be/Xw9pKeJ-4Bw?t=2570[talk at the LPC], you already know that `rustc_codegen_gcc` can now compile Rust for Linux:

image:img/rust-for-linux.png[Rust for Linux compiled with rustc_codegen_gcc]

In this image, we can see Linux modules, built in Rust, and compiled with `rustc_codegen_gcc`, that are being loaded and executed correctly!

It doesn't work on the master branch since it requires 2 features to be implemented:

 * CPU features detection.
 * Some compiler flags support (`-Crelocation-model=static`).

If you want to try compiling Rust for Linux using the GCC codegen, I made a branch for both `rustc_codegen_gcc` and `Rust for Linux`:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/commit/de2f1610d4a55ee557ab344824ed72630d78d055
 * https://github.com/antoyo/linux/commit/c595363d8a67dd55585b92a1b777177f624f9341

It's awesome that we can already compile Rust for Linux with very few hacks: we're very close to being able to compile it on the master branch.

I also made some progress on the stdarch tests:

[script,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 4570 passed; 6 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.48s
----

|===
| Category | Last Month | This Month | Delta

| Passed | 4564 | 4570 | +6
| Failed | 12 | 6 | -6
|===

Some tests were failing due to the fact that I was running them with a sysroot compiled in debug mode.
Indeed, during my investigation, I found out that there is a https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/issues/1336[bug in some tests] that makes them fail even with the LLVM codegen.
That's also by compiling the sysroot in release mode that I found out that some bugs need to be fixed in `rustc_codegen_gcc` regarding undefined behavior:
some tests from libcore fail with a sysroot compiled in release mode due to the optimizers taking advantage of undefined behavior and breaking the code.

And as mentioned in the beginning of this article, some stdarch tests were fixed by making the char type signed.

Unfortunately, I realized that there are many more failures than that when I attempted to https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3170483813/jobs/5181328811#step:18:24394[run those tests in the CI]: since my CPU doesn't support AVX-512, those tests were just passing when running locally.

Here are the results in the CI:

[script,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 3649 passed; 927 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 22.99s

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3171116480/jobs/5164245308#step:19:12026

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support: debugging those tests and fixing the issues found.
I might also work on those AVX-512 failures and the issues with a sysroot compiled in release mode.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
