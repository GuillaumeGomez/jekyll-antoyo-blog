= Rust+GNOME Hackfest #4

Less than 2 weeks ago, I was working on improving the integration of Rust with GNOME libraries at the fourth Hackfest, which happened this time in Thessaloniki.

== Improving ergonomics of gnome-class

As I said in link:{{ site.baseurl }}/rust-gnome-hackfest-madrid[my previous blog post], there is a issue when inheriting from a `gtk::Widget`:

As a reminder, we need to specify both the wrapper widget and its ffi counterpart.

[source,rust]
----
glib_wrapper!(pub struct MyWidget(Object<MyWidgetFFI>): [Widget => GtkWidget];)
----

What I did not specify last time is that we also need to specify all parents.
So, if we were to inherit from a `gtk::Button`, we would need something like:

[source,rust]
----
glib_wrapper!(pub struct MyWidget(Object<MyWidgetFFI>): [Button => GtkButton, Widget => GtkWidget];)
----

But, we do not want the user to have to specify all of this extra information; it would be more ergonomic if the user has to write only `Button` and the proc-macro would figure the rest.
During this Hackfest, I worked on this issue:
thanks to the work of https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2018-04-21+Rust%2BGNOME+Hackfest+in+Madrid[Guillaume Gomez] during the previous Hackfest, I was able to use `gir` as a library and with it, I was able to query the needed info.
https://gitlab.gnome.org/federico/gnome-class/merge_requests/40[Here] is the pull request for this ergonomic improvement.

I also https://gitlab.gnome.org/federico/gnome-class/merge_requests/36[updated the dependencies of gnome-class] and https://gitlab.gnome.org/federico/gnome-class/merge_requests/42[fixed it to be able to use it in an older nightly which was needed in order to combine it with Servo].

== Creating GNOME class for Servo Web View

As I said in my previous blog article, it would be awesome to have a GNOME class for the Servo web view for these reasons:

 * We will be able to use Servo from another language.
 * The users won't have to compile Servo themselves as we will be able to create a shared library with a C API (which is a huge benefit).

Since I fixed the issues we had in gnome-class that were blocking us from creating such a GNOME class, I also worked on creating a GNOME class for the Servo web view.
My work is in https://github.com/antoyo/servo-gtk/tree/feature/gnome-class[this branch] and you can see the almost working example https://github.com/antoyo/servo-gtk/blob/feature/gnome-class/examples/gnome-class.rs[here].
For some reason, Servo broke after this change, perhaps because I had to update a dependency in order to make it work with `gnome-class`:
the code compiles but the widget remains black.
So, we're nearly there and when this branch and the one in `gnome-class` will be merged, we will have the opportunity to have this cool servo GNOME class!

== Relm improvements

I've also worked on https://github.com/antoyo/relm[`relm`] during the Hackfest.

One of the biggest improvement is https://github.com/antoyo/relm/pull/147[the switch to `syn` 0.15] which dramatically improved the error messages.
Before this update, a syntax error in `relm` looked this way:

----
error: custom attribute panicked
  --> examples/buttons-attribute.rs:58:1
   |
58 | #[widget]
   | ^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = help: message: parse() Widget: ParseError(None)
----

Now, it looks like this:

----
error: expected `,`
  --> examples/buttons-attribute.rs:93:26
   |
93 |                     text &self.model.counter.to_string(),
   |                          ^
----

(the message could be better, but at least we know where the error is)

I also fixed a https://github.com/antoyo/relm/issues/20[long standing issue] in `relm` which was that the only way to distinguish a `gtk` widget from a `relm` widget in the `view!` macro was whether its name was a path or an identifier.
This was limiting because you needed to import every `relm` widget you created in order to use them in your views.
Now, you can use the https://github.com/antoyo/relm/pull/149[`$` symbol in order to specify that it is a `relm` widget].

There was also a bug with https://github.com/antoyo/relm/issues/137[`EventStream` that could panic because of a BorrowMut error] if shared between multiple threads.
link:{{ site.baseurl }}/relm-intro#state_mutation[Remember that it was `relm` was created to have no error of this kind], so it was a bit of a shame to still have that kind of issues.
But, it was a very easy fix because it was caused by the Rust compiler to wrongly auto-generate a `Send impl` for this type that should not be shared with other threads.
Indeed, when you want to send a message from another thread in `relm`, you should not use an `EventStream` but a https://github.com/antoyo/relm/blob/master/examples/multithread.rs#L62[Channel].
So https://github.com/antoyo/relm/pull/148[the fix] was simply to make this type non-Send.

I also https://github.com/antoyo/relm/commit/83f518f2b59843a232ecfd5ad25216e599eb3cb0[fixed some links in the documentation].

== Thanks

A big thank to https://github.com/sdroege[Sebastian Dr√∂ge] and Vivia for organizing the Hackfest and a **huge** thank to the GNOME foundation for sponsoring my flight and accommodation to allow me to participate to this Hackfest.
