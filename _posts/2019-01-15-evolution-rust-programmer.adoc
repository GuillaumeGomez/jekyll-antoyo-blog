= The Evolution of a Rust Programmer
:source-highlighter: pygments

== Freshman Rust Programmer

[source,rust]
----
include::_1_freshman/src/main.rs[]
----

== Sophomore Rust Programmer
=== (studied C as a freshman)

[source,rust]
----
include::_2_sophomore/src/main.rs[]
----

== Junior Rust Programmer
=== (read that `unwrap()` foils rust's error management philosophy and joined the "It should be removed in favor of `expect()` "-movement)

[source,rust]
----
include::_3_junior/src/main.rs[]
----

== Senior Rust Programmer
=== (learned proper error management)

[source,rust]
----
include::_4_error_management/src/main.rs[]
----

== Functional Rust Programmer
=== (studied Haskell as a freshman and loathes mutability)

[source,rust]
----
include::_5_functional/src/main.rs[]
----

== Object-oriented Programmer
=== (studied Java as a freshman)

[source,rust]
----
include::_6_oo/src/main.rs[]
----

== Macro-man
=== (misses Lisp macros)

[source,rust]
----
include::_7_macroman/src/main.rs[]
----

== Macroceptor
=== (watched Inception)

[source,rust]
----
include::_8_macroceptor/src/main.rs[]
----

== Procedural Macro God
=== (needs more power)

[source,rust]
.main.rs
----
include::_9_procmacro_god/src/main.rs[]
----

[source,rust]
.lib.rs
----
include::_9_procmacro_god/src/lib.rs[]
----

== Another senior Rust programmer
=== (learned to reduce boilerplate with macros)

[source,rust]
----
include::_10_errorchain/src/main.rs[]
----

== Yet another senior Rust programmer
=== (switched from error-chain to stay up-to-date)

[source,rust]
----
include::_11_failure/src/main.rs[]
----

== Hyper-Functional Rust Programmer
=== (misses Haskell so much that he needs an additional library for more functional power)

[source,rust]
----
include::_12_iter_tools/src/main.rs[]
----

== Combinative Rust Programmer
=== (learned that nom is faster than parsec)

[source,rust]
----
include::_13_nom/src/main.rs[]
----

== Rust Fast and Elegant Parser Writer
=== (learned that pest is faster than nom)

[source,rust]
----
include::_14_pest/src/main.rs[]
----

== Outdated Rust Programmer
=== (learned Rust in 2009)

[source,rust]
----
include::_15_rustc_serialize/src/main.rs[]
----

== Hyped Rust Programmer
=== (learned that serde is the new shiny thing for serialization)

[source,rust]
----
include::_16_serde/src/main.rs[]
----

== Blazingly Concurrent Programmer
=== (wanted a proof that Rust indeed prevents data races)

[source,rust]
----
include::_17_rayon/src/main.rs[]
----

== Outdated Async Rust Programmer
=== (learned Rust async library in 2009)

[source,rust]
----
include::_18_mio/src/main.rs[]
----

== Senior Dependenciely-Typed Rust Programmer
=== (learned to use all the best crates of the Rust ecosystem)

[source,rust]
----
include::_19_dependenciely_typed/src/main.rs[]
----
