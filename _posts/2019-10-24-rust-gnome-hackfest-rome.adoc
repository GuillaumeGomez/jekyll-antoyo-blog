Last week, I went to the sixth Rust+GNOME hackfest which was in Rome.
During these hackfests, we work on improving the integration between
Rust and the GNOME libraries.

== Improvement for builders

In the previous {{ site.baseurl }}/rust-gnome-hackfest-berlin#generate_builder_for_widgets[Hackfest, I added the code generation for builders], but there was something that was not convenient.
The builder methods had the specific type like in:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn application(mut self, application: &Application) -> Self {
    self.application = Some(application.clone());
    self
}
----

Here, the type `Application` could be the parent type of the type of
the variable we have (remember, `GTK+` is object-oriented), which
required explicit upcast from the call as in:

[source,rust]
----
builder.application(&app.upcast());
----

https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/pull/853[I fixed this issue to accept instances of the trait `IsA<_>`:]

[source,rust]
----
pub fn application<P: IsA<Application>>(mut self, application: &P) -> Self {
    self.application = Some(application.clone().upcast());
    self
}
----

So, now we can do:

[source,rust]
----
builder.application(&app);
----

which is way more convenient.

== Compile time improvement to `gir`

The code generator we use to generate most of the code for `GTK+` Rust
bindings, `gir`, was really slow to compile.
On my computer, it used to take 4m15 for a clean release build and
1m30 for a rebuild.
So, making changes to it was annoying since we had to wait a very long
time.
https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/pull/855[I started to make this better by removing dependencies.]
Now, a clean build takes 1m28 and a rebuild, 55s.
There's still a lot of room for improvement, but this requires
significant work: replacing the `regex` crate and rewriting the `toml`
crate so that it does not use `serde`.

== Clone macro

Finally, I created the `clone!` macro which can be really useful to
pass reference counted data to an event handler.

For instance, currently we have to write something like this:

[source,rust]
----
let state = Rc::new(RefCell::new(State::new()));
let state2 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(State::new()));

{
    // Create a new scope to avoid shadowing the references in the
    // outer scope.
    let state = Rc::downgrade(&state);
    let state2 = Rc::clone(&state2);
    application.connect_activate(move |app| {
        let state =
            match state.upgrade() {
                Some(state) => state,
                None => return,
            };
        // Use state and state2.
    }));
}
----

Here, you can see that we have to juggle between downgrading to get a
weak reference and upgrading, which can fail. All of this is really
cumbersome.

And now, we can do this:

[source,rust]
----
let state = Rc::new(RefCell::new(State::new()));
let state2 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(State::new()));

application.connect_activate(clone!(@weak state, state2 => move |app| {
    // Use state and state2.
}));
----

We use the `@weak` marker to specify that we want a weak reference and
no marker for a strong reference.

We can also specify the return value in case we cannot upgrade as in:

[source,rust]
----
clone!(@weak state => @default-return 42, move |_| {
    state.borrow_mut().started = true;
    10
})
----

In this case, if the `state` value was freed, it cannot be upgraded
and this will return `42`.
Otherwise, the code in the closure will be executed and will return
`10`.

Thanks to this macro, it is now much easier to avoid leaking memory by
doing weak references.

== Thanks

A big thank to https://github.com/apiraino[Antonio Piraino] for organizing the
Hackfest, a big thank to https://www.assetdata.it[Asset Data] for the venue and a
**huge** thank to the GNOME foundation for sponsoring my flight and
accommodation to allow me to participate to this Hackfest.
