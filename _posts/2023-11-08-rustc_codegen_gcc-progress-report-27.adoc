== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, we did the following commits, which are yet to be sent on the gcc mailing list:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/31[Allow comparing aligned int types]

Big news this month: we now run part of our tests in the CI of the https://github.com/rust-lang/rust[Rust repo].
This is the first step before we can ship the GCC codegen with `rustup`, which is something we're going to work on in the coming months.

A lot of the progress this month was about fixing issues when cross-compiling to other targets.
We now run some of our tests for the architecture m68k https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/6750548214/job/18353158607[in our CI].

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

Next month, I plan to send libgccjit patches to the mailing list in order to have most of them in GCC 14, to be released next year.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
