== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, we prepared and sent the following patches to the mailing list:

 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001696.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add ability to get CPU features]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001699.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Fix GGC segfault when using -flto]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001702.html[[PATCH\] Add support for function attributes and variable attributes] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001704.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add support for the type bfloat16]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001706.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Fix ira cost segfault]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001707.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit Fix a RTL bug for libgccjit]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001711.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add vector permutation and vector access operations]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001712.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add ways to set the personality function]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001725.html[[PATCH\] libgccjit: Add support for machine-dependent builtins]
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/jit/2023q4/001692.html[[PATCH\] Add missing declaration of get_restrict in C++ interface] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

None of those were merged yet except the last one, but we got some reviews and addressed some of them already.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done during the past month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/374[Do not emit .eh_frame section if using -Cpanic=abort]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/377[Feature/comment section]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/387[Sync from rust 2023/11/17]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/388[Sync from rust 2023/11/21]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/391[Fix build instructions] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

//=== State of compiling popular crates

// TODO: measure time to run tests and RSS (RAM usage).
// TODO: move to after the features table when it's not updated.

Next month, I'll continue to send patches to GCC and address the review of the patches that were already sent and hopefully merge a few of them.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

=== UI tests progress

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job where LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
