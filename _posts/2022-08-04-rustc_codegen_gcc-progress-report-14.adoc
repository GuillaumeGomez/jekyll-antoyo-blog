== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, I did the following:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/e17fec1f60d7d5b0f6a0cbd3ad4e0b06b2d89e6c[Add initial support for variable attributes]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/fb37284fe3d5d802056bbbaf892906be47dabafa[Disable check for unknown sizes in gcc_jit_rvalue_dereference_field to allow recursive types]

Those commits are not yet posted as patches for review since there are not ready.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/200[Sort ui_tests to ensure they remain coherent across different jobs] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/201[Add cache for rust repository] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/202[Cleanup regarding handling of recursive types]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/203[Support symbol visibility]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/204[Fix the mxcsr builtins]

I also looked at CPU features detection, but I haven't anything working for now.

Here is the progress of the stdarch tests:

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/7683580881?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:11661
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/7683580949?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:11661
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/7683581038?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:14691 (failures)

|===
| Category | Last Month | This Month | Delta

| Passed | 4698 | 4698 | 0
| Failed | 57 | 57 | 0
|===

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support: debugging those tests and fixing the issues found.

=== Summary of the failing UI tests.

There was no progress on those tests this month, but I wanted to show a summary describing those failing tests:

|===
| Category | Number of failing tests

| Target features | 1
| Panic | 1
| Undefined reference | 2
| Simd | 19
| Allocator | 9
| Asm | 3
| Unwinding | 3
| Async | 3
| Emit IR | 1
| LTO | 10
| Debug info | 2
| NaN (float) | 2
| Segfault | 1 (this one is on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98458[rust's side])
|===

Those do not include some of the tests that were intentionally disabled for now since the feature is not supported yet
(LTO and unwinding, mainly).

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
