== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC codegen for rustc, meaning that it can be loaded by the existing
rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.

== GCC patches status

No progress on the review of my GCC patches this month.

I did some work that will result in patches when they're ready:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/9[Fix bug where unary_op will return an integer type instead of the correct type]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/8[Add support for target-specific builtins]

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/127[README: Add compiler-rt cloning step] (thanks to JBBgameich!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/130[Update to nightly 2022-02-24] (thanks to bjorn3!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/131[Fix miscompilation when cg_ssa is using multiple builders at the same time] (thanks to bjorn3!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/132[Add dummy unwinding implementation] (Note that this doesn't actually implement unwinding â€” thanks bjorn3!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/133[Don't export global allocs which are not statics] (thanks to bjorn3!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/135[Add support for on_stack parameters]

I also worked on https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/129[SIMD support] but this is not done yet.
The gcc patch adding support for target-specific builtins mentioned
above will also need more work.

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/5354667573?check_suite_focus=true#step:17:7938[CI]:

[script,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 4542 passed; 49 failed; 61 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 669.83s

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.

== Thanks for your support!
