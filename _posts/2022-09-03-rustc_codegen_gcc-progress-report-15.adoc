== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== LPC 2022

I'll be presenting at the
https://lpc.events/event/16/sessions/150/[Linux Plumbers Conference]
in Dublin later this month.
Make sure to attend if you want to discuss using this codegen for any
specific purposes.

== GCC patches status

This month, I did the following:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/f2281090b96f71f3adaf081a6c83a56441bc20ec[Add support for the `used` function attributes]

This commit is not yet posted as a patch for review since it is not ready: there are many more attributes that are not yet supported.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/207[Regenerate intrinsics] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/209[2022/08/26 sync from rust]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/210[Remove extra newline in asm]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/211[Add used function attribute from inline asm]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/213[Fix bitcast to a type of a different size]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/214[simd: implement simd_fmin/fmax] (thanks to sadlerap!)

Here is the progress of the stdarch tests:

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/8104656652?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:12019
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/8104656702?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:12019
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/8104656748?check_suite_focus=true#step:19:15350 (failures)

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support: debugging those tests and fixing the issues found.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
