= rustc_codegen_gcc can now run libcore's tests and pass most of them!

== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
shared library that can be loaded by the Rust compiler to replace the
code generation done by LLVM by another code generator: in this case,
it generates code using GCC or, more precisely, its library
libgccjit. Despite its name, libgccjit can generate code ahead-of-time
(aot) too.

This is very exiting that we can do this because it will allow us to
generate code for architectures that are not supported by LLVM.
Also, it will be nice to see the difference in performance, both in
terms of compile time, but also in terms of run-time of the generated
binaries.

== libcore's tests

Recently, rustc_codegen_gcc was improved enough that it can now run
the tests of libcore.
This is a very important milestone as it means that rustc_codegen_gcc
can compile and run correctly programs of medium complexity.
Moreover, it will allow me to see more easily what bugs need to be
fixed.

Here are the results of running the tests of libcore:

[source,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 1127 passed; 114 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 1 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
----

_The tests of libcore running in 0sâ€¦ Just kidding, that must be
another bug in the code generation._

(The one test that was filtered out was because it was stalling:
another bug to fix.)

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

In order to reach this milestone, multiple features needed to be added
to libgccjit.
I had to wrote as much as 7 https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/tree/master/gcc-patches[gcc patches] that
needs to be applied to upstream gcc in order to run this GCC codegen
for Rust.
Among other things, support was added for thread-local-storage
variables, specifying the link section of a variable, sized integer
types (including 128-bit integers).
Also a reflection API was added and a few bugs were fixed.

In terms of features supported by rustc_codegen_gcc, the following
were added recently and works with varying degrees of stability:

 * Atomics
 * Inline assembly
 * Thread-local storage variables

This project is currently at the point where many programs can be
compiled, but run incorrectly, so my focus will be on fixing this and
adding the other missing features.
