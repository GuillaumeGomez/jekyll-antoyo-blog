== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

During the past 2 months, a lot of progress was made:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/20[Add support for returns_twice attribute in libgccjit] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/21[Add pure attribute support in libgccjit] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/22[Add support for const attribute in libgccjit] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/23[Fix a bug in the GCC garbage collector]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/24[Implement weak and alias function attributes]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/25[Change the type of targetjitm to gcc_targetjitm] (thanks to row454!)
 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/26[Add support for restrict attribute on function parameters] (and https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/pull/27[follow-up PR]) (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

Only the last one was reviewed and https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=29763b002459cba64fa76a6965046792944de41d[merged in GCC upstream].

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/303[Add license explanations]

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/319[Rustify prepare.sh command] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/278[Add support for Link-Time Optimization]

We accomplished quite a lot in the past two months and we finally got the support for Link-Time Optimization (LTO).
LTO is not completely done yet, since there is an issue about some missing symbols when using proc-macros, but I merged the PR anyway since it works in most cases.
I haven't work on ThinLTO yet: I don't know if GCC has something that will be equivalent to LLVM's ThinLTO.

The support for `restrict`/`noalias` brought a performance improvement of 3% in my test program.
Using `hyperfine` to compare it against the same program compiled with the LLVM codegen, we are 3% slower (compared to 5% in last progress report), so we're getter there.
As far as I know, adding the support for `restrict` didn't trigger any bugs in GCC, but that would probably require a crater run to make sure.

Next month, I plan to work on correctly handling the endianness for non-native 128-bit integers.

Here's a rough summary of what has been implemented:

// TODO: remove the (15) LTO tests from the table.

(I removed the LTO tests from the failed row because those tests pass in the CI job were LTO is enabled.)

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
