= Rust+GNOME Hackfest #5
:page-navtitle: Rust+GNOME Hackfest #5

Last week and weekend, I went to the fifth Rust+GNOME hackfest which
was in Berlin again.

== Generate builder for widgets

My goal for this hackfest was to fix this https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/issues/286[issue] I opened nearly three years ago.
The problem is that sometimes you want to create a widget or an object
and set some properties at *construction time*.
This might be needed when you want to set construct-only properties.
For instance, you might want to create a `webkit2gtk::WebView` with a
`WebContext` and a `UserContentManager` at the same time.
That's why a https://github.com/gtk-rs/webkit2gtk-rs/blob/master/src/web_view.rs#L42[constructor] was manually written for this use case.

Now, these manual implementations will become useless thanks to https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/pull/757[work] I
did during the Hackfest.

Now, whenever we tell `gir` to generate a specific builder, it will,
so for the `WebView`, we'll be able to do something like this:

[source,rust]
----
let webview = WebViewBuilder::new()
    .user_content_manager(user_content_manager)
    .web_context(context)
    .build();
----

This PR allows generating builders for construct, construct-only and
writable properties as well as the properties of any of the ancestors
of the object.

Another good point of this work is that all of this is type-safe. If
you look at the https://github.com/gtk-rs/webkit2gtk-rs/blob/master/src/web_view.rs#L44[manual implementation]
more closely, you'll see that it uses strings to specify which
properties to set. That means the previous code was error-prone as
there were no way to check at compile-time that the right type was
used for the values.

A builder setter method looks like this:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn text_lock(mut self, text_lock: &str) -> Self {
    self.text_lock = Some(text_lock.to_string());
    self
}
----

So the user must provide the correct type.

We will generate the builders on a case-by-case basis: for instance,
the next version of `webkit2gtk` will have a `WebViewBuilder`.

== Progress on relm

I also worked on `relm` to fix two long-standing issues:
reduce the number of crates and remove a reference cycle.

=== Merge crates.

The `relm` project had a very big number of crates which was confusing
for users: it used to have 9 crates.
Now, the number is reduced to 3:
`relm` itself, `relm-derive` which provides the procedural macros and
`relm-test` to do GUI testing.
The reason `relm` had such a big number of crates was because
sometimes you might want to use it in a `glib` context without a
graphical user interface.
That's what I did in a https://github.com/antoyo/titanium/tree/master/titanium-web-extension[web browser extension].
In this case, since there is no GUI, you don't want to use all
features of `relm`.

One remaining thing I need to do is to make some crates like `gtk`
optional for this use case.

=== Reference cycle

Another issue I wanted to fix was the https://github.com/antoyo/relm/issues/127[reference cycle issue].
Since the https://github.com/antoyo/relm/blob/4ade1dc8b4530d579c81774a2910b3ce06cab0d9/src/core/mod.rs#L162[`EventStream`]
type contains a `Rc<T>` and it was cloned in GTK+ callbacks without
downgrading them to a https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/rc/struct.Weak.html[`Weak`] reference,
this stream was never released.

This https://github.com/antoyo/relm/pull/171[pull request] now uses a
https://github.com/antoyo/relm/pull/171/files#diff-ad369e8c88b22ab972c1c24ccad4d22fR51[weak reference]
which fixes the issue.

I also simplified the way the messages are processed which will also
make the integration with other toolkits (like `Qt`) much simpler.

This pull request is not merged yet because there's still an issue to
fix, but it will be hopefully resolved soon.

== Thanks

A big thank to https://github.com/zeenix[Zeeshan Ali] for organizing the
Hackfest and a **huge** thank to the GNOME foundation for sponsoring my
flight and accommodation to allow me to participate to this Hackfest.
