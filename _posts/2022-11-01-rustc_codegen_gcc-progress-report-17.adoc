== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[ahead-of-time] codegen for rustc, meaning that it
can be loaded by the existing rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.
It is not to be confused with gccrs, which is a GCC frontend for Rust.

== GCC patches status

This month, I started working on unwinding support, so I made a WIP branch for GCC:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/tree/feature/try

This commit is not yet posted as a patch for review since I'm not done with unwinding support yet.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/229[Fix/fmaddsub]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/230[Fix/simd bitmask]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/231[Fix/simd select bitmask]
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/232[Add missing register class conversion for inline asm] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/233[Bump Github actions] (thanks to paulcacheux!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/234[Remove not applicable rustc patch] (thanks to paulcacheux!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/236[Improve installation documentation] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)
 * https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/238[Fix gcc build instructions] (thanks to GuillaumeGomez!)

This month, I started working on unwinding support: while I have something that compiles, it doesn't run properly yet (e.g. panics can't be caught).

I also made some progress on the https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/actions/runs/3215618935/jobs/5256844833#step:18:9103[stdarch tests ran in the CI] (so this includes AVX-512 tests):

=== UI tests progress

Here are the results of running the UI tests in the CI:

For the next month, I'll continue working on SIMD support: debugging those tests and fixing the issues found.
I'll continue working on unwinding support.

== How to contribute

=== `rustc_codegen_gcc`

If you want to help on the project itself, please do the following:

 1. Run the tests locally.
 2. Choose a test that fails.
 3. Investigate why it fails.
 4. Fix the problem.

Even if you can't fix the problem, your investigation could help, so
if you enjoy staring at assembly code, have fun!

=== Crates and rustc

If you would like to contribute on adding support for Rust on
currently unsupported platforms, you can help by adding the support
for those platforms in some crates like `libc` and `object` and also
in the rust compiler itself.

=== Test this project

Otherwise, you can test this project on new platforms and also compare
the assembly with LLVM to see if some optimization is missing.

=== Good first issue

Finally, another good way to help is to look at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]. Those are issues that should be easier to start with.
