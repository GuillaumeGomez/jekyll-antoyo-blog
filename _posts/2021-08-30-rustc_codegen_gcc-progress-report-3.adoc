== What is rustc_codegen_gcc?

https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc[rustc_codegen_gcc] is a
GCC codegen for rustc, meaning that it can be loaded by the existing
rustc frontend, but benefits from GCC by having more architectures
supported and having access to GCC's optimizations.

== GCC patches status

No progress for the review of my gcc patches this month.

I did create a https://github.com/antoyo/gcc/commit/18d948aa4de76bac8c9650c144bd286ac0ac2ce4[new one]
though: it adds the ability to create register variables, which will
be necessary for inline assembly in order to specify some registers
when the GCC syntax for constraint code is not enough.

== Status of merging into rustc

The https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87260[PR] to merge
rustc_codegen_gcc into rustc was updated according to the comments in
the review.
Currently, it's waiting for reviews to go forward.
When it gets merged, we'll be able to make some useful changes to make 
it easier to implement the gcc codegen and some required changes to
implement some missing features in rustc_codegen_gcc.

== State of rustc_codegen_gcc

Here's what has been done this month:

 * https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/58[Fix undefined
   symbols error for the initialization functions.]
 * https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/59[Write the rustc
   metadata in object files.]

With those fixed, most UI tests pass as can be seen in the
https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/runs/3450998046#step:15:10391[CI]:

[script,bash]
----
test result: FAILED. 4332 passed; 104 failed; 48 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 1249.33s
----

(The number of tests is lower than in a link:{% post_url 2021-06-23-rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-1
%}[previous article], because
https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/57[the tests checking
compilation failure were disabled].)

Some people already started to look at the generated code to compare
its output to LLVM. One case where the gcc codegen was slower than the
LLVM codegen https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/pull/55[is
already fixed]!

Next month, I'll attempt to https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues/65[fix the
initialization of global variables] which should make even more UI
tests pass. (Global variable initialization currently uses a
workaround where they are initialized at runtime, but some code breaks
because of this.)

== Testing of cross-compilation to a new target

Since the primary goal of this project is to be able to run Rust code
on platforms not supported by LLVM, and good progress has been made, I
tried to cross-compile Rust code for the m68k architecture.

I set up a Debian m68k on qemu and built a libgccjit targeting this
architecture.

Aaaaaaaand, good news! I was able to run a "Hello, world!" using the
standard library:

image:img/rust-on-m68k.png[Rust on m68k]

To be able to do so, I had to do a few tweaks:

 * I needed to disable 128-bit integers because the support for these
   integers is not yet done https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues/71[on platforms
where gcc doesn't have them].
 * I needed to choose a rustc target specification close enough to
   m68k because https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88321[m68k was
 not supported in Rust at the time of my tests] (I ended up choosing
 MIPS).

I tried running libcore tests, but they crashed at run-time, seemingly
because https://github.com/antoyo/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues/70[libc for
MIPS does not provide the same values as libc for m68k].
